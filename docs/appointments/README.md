## Usage Examples

### 1. Setting Up Shop Hours (ShopMonkey Style)
```typescript
// Monday-Friday: 8AM-5PM, Sunday/Saturday: Closed
const operatingHours = [
  { dayOfWeek: 'SUNDAY', isOpen: false },
  { dayOfWeek: 'MONDAY', isOpen: true, openTime: '08:00', closeTime: '17:00' },
  { dayOfWeek: 'TUESDAY', isOpen: true, openTime: '08:00', closeTime: '17:00' },
  { dayOfWeek: 'WEDNESDAY', isOpen: true, openTime: '08:00', closeTime: '17:00' },
  { dayOfWeek: 'THURSDAY', isOpen: true, openTime: '08:00', closeTime: '17:00' },
  { dayOfWeek: 'FRIDAY', isOpen: true, openTime: '08:00', closeTime: '17:00' },
  { dayOfWeek: 'SATURDAY', isOpen: false },
];
```

### 2. Creating Canned Services
```typescript
const services = [
  {
    code: 'DYN001',
    name: 'Dyno Tuning - 3 Pulls',
    description: 'Dyno tuning with 3 pulls for performance optimization',
    duration: 120, // 2 hours
    price: 250.00,
    isAvailable: true,
  },
  {
    code: 'BRAKE001',
    name: 'Basic Brake Package',
    description: 'Complete brake inspection and basic brake service',
    duration: 60, // 1 hour
    price: 150.00,
    isAvailable: true,
  },
];
```

### 3. Booking Workflow
1. **Customer selects services**: Choose from available Canned Services
2. **Check availability**: System calculates available slots based on service duration
3. **Create appointment**: Appointment created with PENDING status, no assigned advisor
4. **Admin assignment**: Service advisor assigned to appointment
5. **Work order creation**: Appointment converts to work order when service starts

## Setup

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-appointment-scheduling
```

### 2. Initialize Shop Settings
```bash
npm run setup-appointment-system
```

### 3. Add Routes to Main App
```typescript
import appointmentRoutes from './modules/appointments/appointments.routes';

app.use('/api', appointmentRoutes);
```

## Status Tracking

Appointments follow this status flow:
- `PENDING` - Initial state when created
- `CONFIRMED` - Assigned to service advisor
- `IN_PROGRESS` - Service has started
- `COMPLETED` - Service finished
- `CANCELLED` - Appointment cancelled
- `NO_SHOW` - Customer didn't show up

## Priority Levels

- `LOW` - Non-urgent services
- `NORMAL` - Standard appointments
- `HIGH` - Urgent repairs
- `URGENT` - Emergency services

## Integration with Work Orders

When an appointment is ready to start service:
1. Update appointment status to `IN_PROGRESS`
2. Create work order linked to the appointment
3. Assign technicians to work order
4. Track labor and parts usage
5. Complete work order and payment

This system provides a complete ShopMonkey-inspired appointment scheduling solution with capacity planning, service catalog management, and seamless workflow integration.
